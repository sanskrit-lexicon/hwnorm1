Convention 1 - Treatment of अनुस्वार before consonants and terminal अनुस्वार
  There are at least 6 conventions of handling अनुस्वारs before consonants in झर्‌ प्रत्याहार and terminal अनुस्वारs in various dictionaries. They are described below. When अनुस्वार occurs before any of the letters य,र,ल,व,श,ष,स or ह, it is uniformly depicted as अनुस्वार in all dictionaries. The conventions mentioned below are not applicable to such अनुस्वारs.
Option 1.1
Treat it as fifth letter of the वर्ग of following letter, when in between a word e.g. अङ्क, चञ्चल, खण्ड, प्रशान्त, नितम्बः.
Dictionaries: ACC,AP,BEN,BHS,BOP,BUR,CAE,CCS,GRA,GST,IEG,INM,MCI,MD,MW,MW72,PD,PE,PGN,PUI,PW,PWG,SCH,SHS,SKD,SNP,STC,VCP,VEI,WIL,YAT
Option 1.2
Treat it as अनुस्वार, when occurring in between a word (other than the cases where the first member of compound ends with म्‌) e.g. अभिशंका, कुंचित, पुंड्रः, तंद्रा, विडंबित.
Dictionaries – AP90
Note regarding 1.1 and 1.2 – 
KRM is a special dictionary, whose headwords have only verbs. Therefore, the options 1.1 and 1.2 are not applicable to it.
Option 1.3
Treat it as अनुस्वार when first member of compound ends with म्‌ and the second member of compound starts with झर्‌ letters e.g. संगीत, प्रतिसंधानम्‌.
Dictionaries: ACC,AP,AP90,BEN,BHS,CAE,CCS,MCI,MD,MW,PD,PW,PWG,SCH, STC,VEI,WIL
Option 1.4
Treat it as fifth letter of the वर्ग of following letter, when occurring in the cases where the first member of compound ends with म्‌. e.g. सङ्गीत, निःसन्धि .
Dictionaries: BOP,BUR,GRA,GST,KRM,IEG,INM,MW72,PGN,PUI,SKD,VCP,YAT
Notes regarding 1.3 and 1.4 – 
(1) PE is inconsistent (1.3 and 1.4). See गङ्गासरस्वतीसंगम and वरदासङ्गम. 
(2) SHS is also inconsistent. See सङ्ग्रह and कर्म्मसंग्रह. 
(3) SNP doesn’t have any such case prima facie, hence excluded from this list.
Option 1.5
Use अनुस्वार at the end of a word to denote neuter gender e.g. अकौटिल्यं, जघनं, तैलं.
Dictionaries: AP90,SKD
Option 1.6
Use अनुस्वार at the end of a word to denote अव्ययs mostly (not to denote neuter gender), where usually म्‌ is supposed to be. e.g. अनुकामं, अहर्निशं.
Dictionaries: YAT
Standard convention 1
1. Convert every nasal followed by consonant to अनुस्वार.
2. Convert every terminal अनुस्वार to म्‌.
  It is pertinent to note that majority of dictionaries tend to prefer convention 1.1. So statistically we should lean towards 1.1, but there are a few problems with that approach computationally. Many of the dictionaries following 1.1 also follow 1.3. Therefore, deciding whether to keep it as fifth letter of a वर्ग or अनुस्वार depends on the knowledge of whether it is last letter of a compound or not. Therefore, uniformly converting every internal nasal to अनुस्वार is computationally easier choice.
 
Convention 2 – Treatment of अनुस्वार of verb
      अनुस्वारs in verbs are handled a little differently than convention 1 in dictionaries, so they are treated here separately.
Option 2.1
Verbs are presented with removal of अनुबन्ध and with conversion to fifth letter. e.g. स्तम्भ्‌.
Dictionaries: AP,BEN,BOP,BUR,CAE,CCS,GRA,GST,MD,MW,MW72,PD,PW,PWG,SCH,SHS,STC,YAT
Option 2.2
Verbs are presented as in धातुपाठः e.g. स्तन्भ.
Dictionaries: KRM,PD,SKD,VCP,WIL
Option 2.3
Verbs are presented with removal of अनुबन्ध but without conversion to fifth letter i.e. with अनुस्वार e.g. स्तंभ्‌.
Dictionaries: AP90
      Notes regarding options 2.1 to 2.3 – 
(1) ACC, BHS, IEG, INM, MCI, PE, PGN, PUI, SNP and VEI do not have enough headwords to decide this convention decisively. 
(2) PD tends to give two separate headwords, one following options 2.1 and the other following option 2.2 e.g. अङ्क्, अकि. Therefore, it is included in both categories.
Standard convention 2
Option 2.3.

Convention 3 - Duplication of consonants after 'r'.
Option 3.1
Duplication is not done e.g. पूर्व.
Dictionaries: ACC,AP,AP90,BEN,BHS,BOP,BUR,CAE,CCS,GRA,GST,IEG,INM,KRM,MCI,MD,MW,MW72,PD,PE,PGN,PUI,PW,PWG,SCH,SNP,STC,VCP,VEI
Option 3.2
Duplication is done e.g. पूर्व्व.
    Dictionaries: SKD,WIL
      Note – 
(1) SHS and YAT are inconsistent in this convention. See निर्विघ्न / निर्व्विकल्प in SHS and दुर्वच / दुर्व्वचस्‌ in YAT. 
(2) VCP highly leans towards option 3.1, but there are a few inconsistent entries which follow convention 3.2 e.g. अग्निपर्व्वत c.f. पर्वत (3.1)
Standard convention 3
No duplication.

Convention 4 - Uninflected / inflected forms
Option 4.1
Dictionaries present headwords in inflected forms (प्रथमा विभक्तिः एकवचनम्‌ forms) e.g. धर्मः.
Dictionaries: AP,AP90,SKD
Option 4.2
Dictionaries present headwords in uninflected forms e.g. धर्म.
Dictionaries: BEN,BHS,BOP,BUR,CAE,CCS,GRA,GST,IEG,INM,MCI,MD,MW,MW72,PD,PE,PGN,PUI,PW,PWG,SCH,SHS,SNP,STC,VCP,VEI,WIL,YAT
Note regarding options 4.1 and 4.2 – 
(1) ACC is inconsistent e.g. अनन्ताचार्यः / अचलाचार्य. 
(2) KRM has only verbs as headwords, so it is not included here.
Standard convention 4
Uninflected form
 
Convention 5 – Treatment of ऋकारान्त words
Option 5.1
Uses ऋ at the end e.g. कर्तृ
Dictionaries: ACC,AP,AP90,BEN,BOP,BUR,CAE,GRA,GST,IEG,INM,MD,MW,MW72,PD,SHS,STC,VCP,VEI,WIL,YAT
Option 5.2
Uses अर्‌ instead of ऋ at the end e.g. कर्तर्‌.
Dictionaries: BHS,CCS,PW,PWG,SCH
Option 5.3
Uses inflected form with आ at end e.g. कर्ता
Dictionaries: PUI,SKD
      Note – 
(1) KRM, MCI, PE, PGN, SNP do not have enough data to decide the convention conclusively. 
(2) There is a possibility that a slightly different convention is followed in ऋकारान्त निपातित words e.g. जामातृ. They have not been examined in the current paper.
Standard convention 5
Use ऋ at the end.
 
Convention 6 – Treatment of words ending with ‘at’
Option 6.1
Treat words derived from शतृ suffix as ending with अत्‌ e.g. गच्छत्‌.
Dictionaries: AP,AP90,BOP,BUR,GRA,GST,MD,MW,MW72,PD,SHS,VCP,WIL,YAT
Option 6.2
Treat words derived from शतृ suffix as ending with अन्त्‌ e.g. अनागच्छन्त्‌.
Dictionaries: BEN,BHS,CAE,CCS,PW,PWG,SCH,STC,VEI
Option 6.3
Treat words derived from शतृ suffix as ending with अन्‌ e.g. पश्यन्‌.
Dictionaries: SKD
      Note regarding options 6.1 to 6.3 – 
(1) ACC, IEG, INM, KRM, MCI, PE, PGN, PUI and SNP don’t have enough words with this suffix to decide conclusively conventions 6.1 to 6.3.
Option 6.4
Treat words derived from वतुप्‌ / मतुप्‌ suffix as ending with वत्‌ / मत्‌ e.g. भगवत्‌.
Dictionaries: ACC,AP,AP90,BOP,BUR,GRA,GST,IEG,INM,MCI,MD,MW,PD,SHS,VCP,WIL,YAT
Option 6.5
Treat words derived from वतुप्‌ / मतुप्‌ suffix as ending with वन्त्‌ / मन्त्‌ e.g. भगवन्त्‌.
Dictionaries: BEN,BHS,CAE,CCS,PW,PWG,SCH,STC
      Note for options 6.4 and 6.5 – 
(1) KRM has only verbs as headwords, so it is not included here.
Standard convention 6
Treat all words mentioned above as ending with अत्‌.
 
Convention 7 – Treatment of वस्वन्त words
Option 7.1
Use वस्‌ at end e.g. विद्वस्‌.
Dictionaries: AP,AP90,BOP,BUR,CCS,GRA,GST,INM,MCI,MW,MW72,PD,PE,SHS,VCP,WIL,YAT
Option 7.2
Use अंस्‌ at the end e.g. विद्वंस्‌.
Dictionaries: CAE,PW,PWG,SCH
  Option 7.3
Use आंस्‌ at end e.g. विद्वांस्‌.
Dictionaries: BHS,MD,STC
Option 7.4
Use आन्‌ at the end e.g. विद्वान्‌.
Dictionaries: PUI,SKD
    Note – 
(1) ACC, BEN, IEG, PGN, SNP and VEI do not have enough data to decide the convention conclusively. 
(2) KRM does not have such headwords, so it is excluded from this list.
Standard Convention 7
Use वस्‌ at the end.

Convention 8
Analysis of conventions regarding the तकारान्त words like महत्‌ / महन्त् / महन्त्‌ / महान्‌ etc. is not yet done. A dump of a sample word महत्‌ is noted below for reference. This requires closer look, because at least PUI, PW and SKD follow inconsistent convention.
a.महत्:AP,AP90,BHS,BOP,BUR,GRA,INM,MD,MW,MW72,PUI,PW,SHS,SKD,VCP,WIL,YAT
b.   महन्त्‌:BEN,CAE,CCS,IEG,PW,PWG,SCH
c.   महान्त्‌:STC
d.   महान्‌:PE,PUI,SKD


Convention 9 
Analysis of सकारान्त words is pending.
Convention 10
