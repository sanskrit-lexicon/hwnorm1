# Convention 1 - Treatment of anusvAra (अनुस्वार)
	There are at least 6 conventions of handling anusvAra in various dictionaries. They are described below. When anusvAra occurs before any of the letters य,र,ल,व,श,ष,स or ह, it is uniformly depicted as ‘M’. The conventions mentioned below are not applicable to these categories.
##Option 1.1
Treat it as `M` when occuring in between a word (other than the cases where the first member of compound ends with `m`) e.g. akuMWita.
Dictionaries – AP90
##Option 1.2
Treat it as fifth letter of the varga of following letter, when in between a word. e.g. caYcala.
Dictionaries: ACC,AP,BEN,BHS,BOP,BUR,CAE,CCS,GRA,GST,IEG,INM,MCI,MD,MW,MW72,PD,PE,PGN,PUI,PW,PWG,SCH,SHS,SKD,SNP,STC,VCP,VEI,WIL,YAT
	Note regarding 1.1 and 1.2 – KRM is a special dictionary, whose headwords are verbs only. Therefore, the options 1.1 and 1.2 are not applicable to it.
##Option 1.3
Use `M` at the end of a word to denote neuter gender e.g. akOwilyaM. 
Dictionaries: AP90,SKD
##Option 1.4
Use `M` at the end of a word to denote avyayas mostly (not to denote neuter gender), where usually `m` is supposed to be. e.g. anukAmaM.
Dictionaries: YAT
##Option 1.5
Treat as `M` when first member of compound ends with `m` and the second member of compound starts with झर् letters e.g. saMgIta.
Dictionaries: ACC,AP,AP90,BEN,BHS,CAE,CCS,MCI,MD,MW,PD,PW,PWG,SCH, STC,VEI,WIL
##Option 1.6
Treat as fifth letter of the varga of following letter, when occuring in the cases where the first member of compound ends with `m`. e.g. saNgIta.
Dictionaries: BOP,BUR,GRA,GST,KRM,IEG,INM,MW72,PGN,PUI,SKD,VCP,YAT
	Notes regarding 1.5 and 1.6 – (1) PE is inconsistent regarding conventions 1.5 and 1.6. It has gaNgAsarasvatIsaMgama as well as varadAsaNgama. (2) SHS is also inconsistent. Please see saNgraha and karmmasaMgraha. (3) SNP doesn’t have such case prima facie. 
## Suggested standard convention for normalization
1. Convert every nasal followed by consonant to `M`.
2. Convert every terminal `M` to `m`.
	It is pertinent to note that majority of dictionaries tend to prefer convention 1.2. So statistically we should lean towards 1.2, but there are a few problems with that approach computationally. Many of the dictionaries following 1.2 also follow 1.5. Therefore, deciding whether to keep it as fifth letter of a varga or anusvAra depends on the knowledge of whether it is last letter of a compound or not. Therefore, uniformly converting every internal nasal to ‘M’ is computationally easier choice.

# Convention 2 - Duplication of consonants after 'r'.
## Option 2.1
Duplication is done in all cases e.g. pUrvva.
Dictionaries: SKD,WIL
## Option 2.2
Duplication is done only if ‘r’ is part of the same pada.
Dictionaries: VCP
## Option 2.3
Duplication is not done e.g. pUrva.
Dictionaries: ACC,AP,AP90,BEN,BHS,BOP,BUR,CAE,CCS,GRA,GST,IEG,INM,KRM,MCI,MD,MW,MW72,PD,PE,PGN,PUI,PW,PWG,SCH,SNP,STC,VEI 
	Note – (1) SHS and YAT are inconsistent in this convention. See nirviGna / nirvvikalpa in SHS and durvaca / durvvacas in YAT.
## Standard convention
No duplication.

# Convention 3 – Treatment of words ending with ‘at’
## Option 3.1
Treat words derived from शतृ suffix as ending with 'at' e.g. ‘gacCat’.
Dictionaries: AP,AP90,BOP,BUR,GRA,GST,MD,MW,MW72,PD,SHS,VCP,WIL,YAT
## Option 3.2
Treat words derived from शतृ suffix as ending with 'ant' e.g. anAgacCant.
Dictionaries: BEN,BHS,CAE,CCS,PW,PWG,SCH,STC,VEI
## Option 3.3
Treat words derived from शतृ suffix as ending with 'an' e.g. paSyan.
Dictionaries: SKD
	Note – (1) ACC, IEG, INM, KRM, MCI, PE, PGN, PUI and SNP don’t have enough words with this suffix to decide conclusively conventions 3.1 to 3.3.
## Option 3.3
Treat words derived from वतुप् / मतुप् suffix as ending with 'vat' / 'mat' e.g. Bagavat.
Dictionaries: ACC,AP,AP90,BOP,BUR,GRA,GST,IEG,INM,MCI,MD,MW,PD,SHS,VCP,WIL,YAT
## Option 3.4
Treat words derived from वतुप् / मतुप् suffix as ending with 'vant' / 'mant' e.g. Bagavant.
Dictionaries: BEN,BHS,CAE,CCS,PW,PWG,SCH,STC 
	Note for options 3.3 and 3.4 – (1) KRM has only verbs as headwords, so it is not included here.
## Standard convention
Treat all words mentioned above as ending with ‘at’.

# Convention 4 - Uninflected / inflected forms
## Option 4.1
Dictionaries present headwords in inflected forms (praTamA viBaktiH ekavacanam forms) e.g. DarmaH.
Dictionaries: AP,AP90,SKD
## Option 4.2
Dictionaries present headwords in uninflected forms e.g. Darma.
Dictionaries: BEN,BHS,BOP,BUR,CAE,CCS,GRA,GST,IEG,INM,MCI,MD,MW,MW72,PD,PE,PGN,PUI,PW,PWG,SCH,SHS,SNP,STC,VCP,VEI,WIL,YAT
Note regarding options 4.1 and 4.2 – (1) ACC is inconsistent e.g. anantaAcAryaH / acalAcArya. (2) KRM has only verbs as headwords, so it is not included here.
## Standard convention
Uninflected form

# Convention 5 – Treatment of anusvAra of verb
	anusvAras in verbs are handled a little differently than convention 1 in dictionaries, so they are treated here separately.
## Option 5.1
Verbs are presented as in dhAtupATha e.g. stanBa.
Dictionaries: KRM,PD,SKD,VCP,WIL
## Option 5.2
Verbs are presented with removal of anubandhas and with conversion to fifth letter. e.g. stamB.
Dictionaries: AP,BEN,BOP,BUR,CAE,CCS,GRA,GST,MD,MW,MW72,PD,PW,PWG,SCH,SHS,STC,YAT
## Option 5.3
Verbs are presented with removal of anubandha but without conversion to fifth letter i.e. with anusvAra e.g. staMB.
Dictionaries: AP90
	Notes regarding options 5.1 to 5.3 – (1) ACC, BHS, IEG, INM, MCI, PE, PGN, PUI, SNP, VEI do not have enough headwords to decide this convention decisively. (2) PD tends to give two separate headwords, one following options 5.1 and the other following option 5.2 e.g. aki, aNk. Therefore, it is included in both categories.
## Standard convention
Option 5.3 . 

# Convention 6 – Treatment of ऋकारान्त words
## Option 6.1
Uses 'ar' instead of 'f' at the end e.g. kartar.
Dictionaries: BHS,CCS,PW,PWG,SCH
## Option 6.2 
Uses 'f' at the end e.g. kartf
Dictionaries: ACC,AP,AP90,BEN,BOP,BUR,CAE,GRA,GST,IEG,INM,MD,MW,MW72,PD,SHS,STC,VCP,VEI,WIL,YAT
## Option 6.3
Uses inflected form with 'A' at end e.g. kartA
Dictionaries: PUI,SKD
	Note – (1) KRM, MCI, PE, PGN, SNP do not have enough data to decide the convention conclusively.
## Standard convention
Use 'f' at the end.

# Convention 7 – Treatment of वस्वन्त words
## Option 7.1
Use 'vas' at end e.g. vidvas.
Dictionaries: AP,AP90,BOP,BUR,CCS,GRA,GST,INM,MCI,MW,MW72,PD,PE,SHS,VCP,WIL,YAT
## Option 7.2
Use 'AMs' at end e.g. vidvAMs
Dictionaries: BHS,MD,STC
## Option 7.3
Use 'An' at the end e.g. vidvAn
Dictionaries: PUI,SKD
## Option 7.4
Use 'aMs' at the end e.g. ‘vidvaMs’
Dictionaries: CAE,PW,PWG,SCH
	Note – (1) ACC, BEN, IEG, PGN, SNP and VEI do not have enough data to decide the convention conclusively. (2) KRM does not have such headwords, so it is excluded from this list.
## Standard Convention
Use 'vas' at the end.

# TODO
1.	Analysis of conventions regarding the takArAnta words like mahat / mahant / mahAnt / mahAn etc. is not yet done. A dump of a sample word ‘mahat’ is noted below for reference. This requires closer look, because at least PUI, PW and SKD follow inconsistent convention.
a.	mahat:AP,AP90,BHS,BOP,BUR,GRA,INM,MD,MW,MW72,PUI,PW,SHS,SKD,VCP,WIL,YAT
b.	mahant:BEN,CAE,CCS,IEG,PW,PWG,SCH
c.	mahAnt:STC
d.	mahAn:PE,PUI,SKD
2.	There is a possibility that a slightly different convention is followed in ऋकारान्त निपातित words e.g. jAmAtf. They have not been examined in the current paper.
