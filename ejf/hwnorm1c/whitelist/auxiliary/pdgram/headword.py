"""
The above coding=utf-8 is required in python2 versions, so the broken-bar
character in reHeadword is properly interpreted. 
See http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/
headword.py contains the regular expression for recognizing headwords.
 The first group is key1, the 2nd is key2. The third may be empty or
 a homonym, in format ^n.  These homonym numbers may be references to
 the homonym number in PW.
